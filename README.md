Movie ratings combined with social media. 

In this web application, instead of seeing the world's ratings on movies, you only see those who you follow. 
Thus, not only can you further connect with friends, but you can see the opinions of those that you know rather than those of the world at large.

Current major features:
- See an activity feed of your friends' reviews as they make them
- Search from a database of all movies
- Rate movies
- See friends' movie ratings, and a combined listing of top movies by friend rating
- Create movie lists, keep them public or private, and allow other friends to edit your lists
