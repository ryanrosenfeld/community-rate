The intersection of social media and movie ratings. 

In this web application, instead of seeing the world's ratings on movies you only see your friends'. Increase collaboration with friends, find out what movies they're seeing and what they thought of them, find out what movie to watch next, and so much more!

Current major features:
- See an activity feed of your friends' reviews as they make them. Make comments on their ratings show your agreement or why you think they're totally wrong.
- Search from a database of all movies
- Rate movies
- See friends' movie ratings, and a combined listing of top movies by friend rating
- Create movie lists, keep them public or private, and allow other friends to edit your lists
